# Salmonella_TraDIS_MscProject

In this resporitory, I you can find the datafiles and scripts used for analysing M-SL1344, M-D23580, HeLa cells, and M-RNAseq. The files needed for the analysis and the respective scripts are added to respective folders.
I also added a folder where I added all datasets ultimately used for later integrated analyses, including a script where I compiled them into a large dataframe.
